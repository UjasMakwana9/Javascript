// Yes, that's correct. In JavaScript, the super keyword can only be used within the constructor of a derived class.
// Here's why:
// Purpose of super:
// The primary purpose of super is to call the constructor of the parent class, allowing you to initialize inherited properties and set up the inheritance chain properly.
// Constructor Context:
// The super() call must be the first statement in the constructor of the derived class. This ensures that the parent class constructor is executed before any initialization logic in the child class constructor.
// Outside Constructor:
// Using super outside of the constructor context doesn't make sense because it's specifically designed for interacting with the parent class constructor during object initialization.

class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }
  }
  
  class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
      super(name); // Call the parent class constructor
      this.breed = breed;
    }
  }
  
  const myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
  console.log(myDog.name); // Output: "Buddy" 
  console.log(myDog.breed); // Output: "Golden Retriever"
